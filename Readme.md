## Introduction

Django is an open-source web framework that lets you build robust web applications quickly and securely with minimal code. This course covers:
- Rapid application development with Django.
- Built-in security features and user authentication.
- Creating and managing dynamic webpages and database-driven applications.
- Utilizing Django’s admin interface, ORM, class-based views, and forms for validation.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** – A virtual environment is recommended.
- **Django 3.2+** – Although this course was built with Django 3.2, later versions are supported.
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) and a modern browser.
- Basic understanding of HTTP and web development concepts.

---

## Course Outline

### 1. Introduction to Django
- Overview of Django’s philosophy: simplicity, rapid development, and security.
- Why Django is a preferred framework for building web applications.

### 2. Starting Your Django Project
- Using `django-admin startproject` to create a new project.
- Project structure: `manage.py`, settings, URLs, and initial configurations.

### 3. Django Built-In User Management
- Exploring Django’s admin interface.
- Creating and managing users, and applying database migrations.
- Implementing signup, login, and password management.

### 4. Interacting with Databases using Django ORM
- Defining models to represent database tables.
- Running migrations and using the Django shell.
- **Challenge:** Adding a "likes" field to a note model.

### 5. Building Dynamic Webpages
- Creating views that render HTML using Django’s template language.
- Implementing loops, conditionals, and variable interpolation.
- Using class-based views for list and detail pages.
- **Challenge:** Filtering and displaying popular notes.

### 6. Building Robust Front-Ends
- Managing static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) in Django.
- Creating a base template for consistent styling.
- Using Bootstrap to enhance design and layout.
- Dividing templates into reusable parts using the `include` tag.

### 7. Django Forms and Validation
- Implementing forms for creating, updating, and deleting data.
- Adding server-side validation with custom error messages.
- Ensuring secure form submissions with CSRF tokens.
- **Challenge:** Custom validation to accept only notes about Django.

### 8. Working with Existing Data (CRUD)
- Updating and deleting records using UpdateView and DeleteView.
- Integrating function-based views for custom actions (e.g., upvoting notes).
- **Challenge:** Adding a like button that updates note data securely.

### 9. User-Specific Data and Sharing
- Associating notes with users via foreign keys.
- Overriding querysets to display data for the logged-in user only.
- **Challenge:** Marking notes as public or private and generating shareable links.

### 10. Login, Logout, and Signup
- Customizing authentication views and templates.
- Implementing a navigation bar that reflects the user's login state.
- Adding signup functionality and integrating redirection after login.
- **Challenge:** Creating a share link for public notes that works for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

### 11. Conclusion and Next Steps
- Recap of what you’ve built and learned.
- Next steps: Exploring unit testing, Django REST framework, and advanced Django topics.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-django-repo.git
cd your-django-repo

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Django (and other dependencies if needed)
pip install django

# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser for the admin interface
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run the development server
python manage.py runserver
```
---

## Usage

- **Admin Interface:** Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) to manage users and view models.
- **Notes App:** Navigate through the various endpoints to:
  - Create, update, and delete notes.
  - Toggle between public and private notes.
  - Share public notes via generated links.
- **Authentication:** Use the custom login, logout, and signup pages to secure your application.

---

## Challenges

Throughout the course, several hands-on challenges help solidify your understanding:
- **Adding a Like Feature:** Extend your note model with a “likes” field and update it via a POST request.
- **Filtering Popular Notes:** Use Django’s QuerySet methods to display notes that meet specific criteria.
- **Template Modularization:** Break down your HTML into reusable components using `include`.
- **User-Specific Data:** Ensure that each user only sees their own notes by customizing the QuerySet in class-based views.
- **Public vs. Private Notes:** Implement a toggle for notes’ visibility and secure public sharing.

Feel free to explore these challenges further or add your own enhancements.
